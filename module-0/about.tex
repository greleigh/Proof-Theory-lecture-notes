These lecture notes are written to accompany the course \emph{Proof Theory} given to second semester students of the \emph{Master in Logic} at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.
This means that I assume reader is comfortable with elementary formal logic including propositional and predicate (i.e., first-order) logic and natural deduction.
The first half of the text \emph{Logical Theory}~\cite{LogThe} covers the assumed material and more.
The latter half of this course deals with Peano arithmetic and incompleteness.
Although designed to be self-contained, the reader will benefit from a having seen these two topics before (see, again, \emph{Logical Theory}).
